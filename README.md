# Project 1

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains a small Python project (a Jupyter notebook) created as part of a learning exercise. The goal is to provide a clear, reproducible example that shows how to set up and run the notebook locally.

**Features:**

- **Notebook-based exploration:** Interactive analysis and examples in `project1.ipynb`.
- **Minimal dependencies:** Easy to install and run in a virtual environment.
